He got a job as a cabin boy and the kitchen hand on the cargo ship ‘Tahiti” and after four years travelling the Pacific Islands to San Francisco and return he jumped ship in San Francisco at the age of 18. He got a job in a Restaurant at the corner of Market & Farrelly Streets near Union Square and worked his way up to Manager in 1924.\n\nIn 1925 he came upon 6 Green Parrot lampshades in Macy’s half yearly sales which he purchased and eventually decided to return to New Zealand. The Restaurant, named after these lampshades, The Green Parrot opened in 1926. ",
